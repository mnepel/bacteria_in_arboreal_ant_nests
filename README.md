# bacteria_in_arboreal_ant_nests
R analysis scripts studying bacterial communities in arboreal ant nests. Scripts are linked to the paper titled "Highly diverse bacterial communities in arboreal ants’ nesting space develop conjoined with ant colonies"

# Raw sequencing data
The raw sequencing reads and meta data are deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive under the BioProject accession number PRJNA777006

# ASV count table (metaASVcountTableSeq.txt)
The ASV count table also includes metadata and representative sequences.

# Alpha diversity (Shannon indices.xls)
Shannon indices can be found in this file, repreentign the source data behind the alpha diversity plots. Defferent sheets represent different Figures.
